Around Seattle: UBER CAR SERVICE The Uber app connects you to a driver at the tap of a button. Once the app is installed on your phone you can pull up a map to see the cars in your area. When you install the app you will put in your payment information. Once ready for a car simply pull up the app, drop a pin at your location, and wait for a car in the area to confirm they will pick you up.
